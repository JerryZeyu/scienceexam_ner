Students are investigating which type of fruit attracts the most fruit flies. Equally sized pieces of ripe apple, peach, and banana are placed in separate containers. The containers allow fruit flies to enter, but the fruit flies are unable to escape. The containers are placed outside on a picnic table for two days. The most reliable method for collecting data is to count the number of fruit flies
(A) on all three types of fruit every two hours
(B) on all three types of fruit after each fruit spoils
(C) on the banana on Day 1, the apple on Day 2, and the peach on Day 3
(D) on the banana after Hour 1, the apple after Hour 2, and the peach after Hour 3

Many horses grow a heavy coat in autumn and shed that coat in spring. Scientists were not sure if temperature or the amount of daylight per day (called the photoperiod) caused the change. So, they conducted an experiment and concluded that the change in photoperiod was responsible for the biological changes. Shedding caused by which set of conditions would have helped them arrive at this conclusion?
(A) a constant photoperiod, but varied temperatures
(B) a varied photoperiod, and varied temperatures
(C) a constant photoperiod, and a constant temperature
(D) a varied photoperiod, but a constant temperature

Scientists measured the patterns of spectral lines given off by distant galaxies and concluded that almost all of these galaxies are moving away from Earth. What did the scientists observe directly?
(A) a shift toward longer wavelengths of light
(B) a shift toward shorter wavelengths of light
(C) the absence of wavelengths in the visible light range
(D) the compression of wavelengths in the visible light range
