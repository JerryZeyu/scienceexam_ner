A population of wood mice lives in a cool, moist temperate forest. Several years of hot, dry weather have affected the plants in the area. Which mice in the population are most likely to survive this change and pass their genes on to their offspring?
(A) those with the warmest coats and best camouflage
(B) the largest and strongest mice in the population
(C) those with traits most adapted to the new environment
(D) the youngest and fastest mice in the population

As a habitat with a small pond goes through a long drought, which of these is most likely to happen to many of the fish in the pond?
(A) They would adapt to the dry environment.
(B) They would live on other sources of water.
(C) They would move to another habitat.
(D) They would be unable to survive.

When a predator feeding on certain prey is removed from the environment, which variable will most likely determine whether or not the prey will survive?
(A) temperature
(B) available food
(C) relative humidity
(D) competition with other species

In the Everglades, the body condition of the American alligator is closely related to water depth. When water levels rise too high, animal species disperse across a broader area, causing a decrease in body condition due to an inability to locate sufficient food sources. When water levels fall, the animal species gather in smaller areas, allowing alligators to hunt more effectively. This scenario is an example of how the survival of alligators is dependent upon the restriction of which factor?
(A) decomposition rate
(B) prey habitat area
(C) producer output
(D) water turnover

Which event most likely allowed for the explosion of mammal diversity that occurred during the Cretaceous period?
(A) formation of the supercontinent Pangea
(B) intense volcanic activity
(C) cooler temperatures
(D) rising sea levels

The Florida Bog Frog (Lithobates okaloosae) inhabits shallow stream overflows in three counties in Florida. With such a small geographic habitat, any change in the frog's environment could cause drastic changes in the population. Which would most likely affect the frog population if acid rain changed the pH of the water?
(A) Prey insects would become inedible.
(B) Tadpoles would be unable to survive.
(C) Breeding sites would become unavailable.
(D) Predators would choose another food source.
