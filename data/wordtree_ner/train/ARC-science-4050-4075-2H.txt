In 2005, a team of scientists discovered a photosynthetic bacteria living near the molten lava of a thermal vent ecosystem deep in the Pacific Ocean. The bacteria lived 2400 meters below the surface of the ocean, yet made energy from photosynthesis. Which conclusion best explains the results?
(A) Photosynthesis can occur without light.
(B) The hydrothermal vent emits usable light.
(C) High water pressure can power photosynthesis.
(D) The bacteria used to live at the ocean's surface.

Asbestos fibers cause a cancer called mesothelioma in humans. The fibers kill cells that line lung tissue by causing programmed-cell death. When cells die this way, they release a chemical, HMG1, which causes an inflammatory response in other cells. During this inflammatory response, cells release chemicals that promote tumor growth. What conclusion can you draw about the chemicals released in the inflammatory response?
(A) They decrease the amount of HMG1 in a feedback loop.
(B) They increase the amount of HMG1 in a feedback loop.
(C) They disrupt the normal circadian rhythms.
(D) They disrupt the normal cell cycle.

A scientist was investigating why several fish caught from a local stream displayed similar mutations. He found that the water temperature of the stream was elevated since an industrial plant began discharging heated water into the stream. The scientist concluded that increased water temperature during the egg phase led to the mutation in the fish. According to this conclusion, the mutation was caused by
(A) an autoimmune disorder.
(B) a congenital defect.
(C) an environmental condition.
(D) an injury from a predator.

A chemist observed bubbling and fizzing after adding an acid solution to a white powdery substance in a beaker. Which of the following can be inferred?
(A) The acid boiled when poured into the beaker.
(B) The acid and powder formed a new product.
(C) A physical reaction produced a gas mixture.
(D) A reaction occurred that produced heat.

Four students compared the total mass of the products to the total mass of the reactants after performing three trials of the same chemical reaction. Each student concluded that the total mass of the products was slightly less than the total mass of the reactants. Each student proposed a different explanation as follows. Student 1: The reaction converted some of the reactant mass to energy. Student 2: The chemical reaction produced a gas that escaped. Student 3: Some of the mass measurements were made with insufficient precision. Student 4: Heat released during the reaction caused the volume of the products to increase.Which students offered the most reasonable explanations?
(A) Students 1 and 3
(B) Students 1 and 4
(C) Students 2 and 3
(D) Students 2 and 4

A cupful of water and a similar cupful of gasoline were placed on a table near a window on a hot sunny day. A few hours later it was observed that both the cups had less liquid in them but that there was less gasoline left than water. What does this experiment show?
(A) All liquids evaporate.
(B) Gasoline gets hotter than water.
(C) Some liquids evaporate faster than others.
(D) Liquids will only evaporate in sunshine.
(E) Water gets hotter than gasoline
