[Mercury_7183505] [LIFE_INTERDEP_SUCCESSION]
When high winds knocked down pine trees in a wooded region, it created a gap in the crowded canopy and allowed sunlight to fall on the ground. The increased sunlight allowed a dense growth of raspberry plants which protected young pine seedlings from being eaten by herbivores. Over time, the pine seedlings grew and blocked sunlight from falling on the woodland floor, thereby preventing growth of more raspberry plants. Which of these terms best describes the process of change observed in this woodlands community?
(A) adaptation
(B) cooperation
(C) natural selection
(D) ecological succession
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
